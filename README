ATTENTION: This package is written to be run in a Red Hat or Ubuntu
           environment. Tweaks may be needed for other distributions.

This is a package of utility programs that help your productivity
when editing MUMPS/GT.M routines with the vim editor, preferrably
version 6.0 or newer.

NOTE: In order to use the mtags functionality, you must build a tags
      file. In order to build the tags file with the included mktags
      shell script, you will need to install the ctags program. In
      Ubuntu you would install it via:
          $ sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags
      In Red Hat/CentOS you would install it via:
          $ sudo yum install ctags
      You have to use a version of ctags with regular expression support
      compiled in, in order to build the tags file for MUMPS. To confirm
      that your version is the correct one:
          $ ctags --version
      Look for this line:
          "Optional compiled features: +wildcards, +regex"

NOTE: In order to use the global dump functionality you
      must install GT.M and set the environment variables that GT.M
      requires. http://www.fisglobal.com/products-technologyplatforms-gtm

A colleague of mine, John Willis <chocolatejollis38@gmail.com>, has created
a similar package of tools for use with the emacs editor. It is called
LorikeeM and you can download it from: http://code.google.com/p/lorikeem/
LorikeeM also includes my KBAWDUMP.m routine for support of global dumps
inside of vim or emacs, and my mktags/mtags.sh script for building a tags
file for either vim or emacs.

Any reference to m-tools in the commands below, may also have a version
number in it.

To install this, you untar the tarball, as you've already done..
      $ tar xfz m-tools.tgz

Then you move to the resulting m-tools/ directory..
      $ cd m-tools/

Or, you can clone the repository with the instructions on the bitbucket
page. https://bitbucket.org/dlw/m-tools

Then you run the install script to install the m-tools utility
scripts, in the appropriate places, as well as create a .vimrc run
command file, or append or overwrite your current one. This is
to ensure that the package works correctly. It will also install
a MUMPS/GT.m routine, which is necessary to use the mtags/ctags
functionality, and a man page for the mktags shell script, which will
create the tags file necessary for the mtags/ctags functionality..
      $ ./install

If you want to install m-tools manually, make sure you copy the
following files and directories to the right places at a minimum.
<MUMPS-source-directory> refers to a directory in your gtmroutines
environment variable. 
      $ cp m-tools/KBAWDUMP.m <MUMPS-source-directory>
      $ cp m-tools/mktags ~/bin
      $ cp m-tools/vim ~/.vim
      $ cp m-tools/vimrc ~/.vimrc
You will also need to install the mktags and KBAWDUMP man pages. For
information on how to do that on your system, consult the man page:
      $ man man
You will also need to install the m-tools.txt vim help documentation.
In a vim editing session, type:
      :helptags ~/.vim/doc

That is pretty much all there is to it. If you have questions on how
to use the mktags shell script, consult the man page..
      $ man mktags

If you have any questions on how to use the KBAWDUMP.m MUMPS/GT.M
routine, consult the man page..
      $ man KBAWDUMP

If you have questions on how to use any of the features of the m-tools
package, consult the vim help page, built-in to the package, and
accessed inside of any vim editing session..
      :help m-tools
