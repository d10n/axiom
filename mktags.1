.TH MKTAGS 1 "03 December 2011" "Version 0.9.6" "M-TOOLS Utilities"

.SH NAME
\fBmktags\fP - A script to build a tags file for use with the M-tools package

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mktags
.BI "[-ep] -g"

.B mktags
.BI "[-ep] \fIfile(s)\fP"


.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mktags
is a shell script that will create a tags file containing MUMPS labels for use
with the M-tools package.
.PP
Normally you would call it via cron once or more daily to keep your tags file
up to date.

.SH OPTIONS
The following command line flags are optional. At least -g or a list of
files is required.
.IP -g
Parse the $gtmroutines environment variable, going through the specified
directories, building a tags file called ~/.mtags or ~/.MTAGS.
.IP -e
Run in emacs mode, building a tags file called ~/.MTAGS or ~/MTAGS in emacs
format.
.IP -p
Run in post sort mode. Normally ctags runs recursively, but because of the
difference between the internal and external format of GT.M files (% vs. _),
it has to be run individually for each routine. So mktags will keep appending
to the tags file. By default, it will keep the tags file sorted, for faster
lookups by Vim, after every routine. If you have a small amount of GT.M
routines on your system, this works just fine. But when you have a large
amount of routines to tag, like with VistA or any other large system, this
can take a long time. In that case, use post sort mode, which should speed up
the mktags script a lot.

.SH LOGS
The mktags script will log everything it does to a log file called
~/log/mktags.log

.SH EXAMPLE
Normally mktags is run from the command line in post sort mode, on each
directory listed in the $gtmroutines environment variable. E.g.

        $ mktags -gp

If you want, you can run it from cron by adding it to your crontab file. Keep
in mind that you will either need to use the full path to mktags, or you will
need to define $PATH in your crontab file. If you are using the -g option, you
will need to make sure to source the file that builds the $gtmroutines
environment variable, since the -g option requires that it be defined.
Running mktags from cron could be done to keep your tags file up-to-date.
Then it will keep up with added, removed, or modified MUMPS routines.

.SH BUGS
There are no known bugs.
