.TH KBAWDUMP 1 "25 November 2011" "Version 0.9.0" "M-TOOLS Utilities"

.SH NAME
\fBKBAWDUMP\fP - A MUMPS/GT.M routine for use with the m-tools package

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mumps -r KBAWDUMP \fPglobal

.B mumps -r KBAWDUMP \fP'global(subscript[,subscript]...)'

.B mumps -r GLOBALS^KBAWDUMP

.B mumps -r GLOBALS^KBAWDUMP "\fP<first-global>:<last-global>"


.SH DESCRIPTION
.B KBAWDUMP
is a MUMPS/GT.M routine that will display the contents of a MUMPS global, with
or without subscripts.
.PP
.B
Note
that if you specify a subscript(s), you must enclose the
global reference in tics, or single-quotes ('). This is to ensure that your
shell doesn't try to start a subshell when it sees the parens.
.PP
It does not require that you supply the initial ^ of a global reference.

.PP
.B GLOBALS^KBAWDUMP
is a MUMPS/GT.M routine calling point that will display all of the globals in
a GT.M database. You may also specify a range in this form:
.IP
<first-global>:<last-global>
.PP
It will then display every global in a GT.M database starting with
<first-global> and ending with <last-global>, inclusive.
.PP
If you do not supply a global before the colon, it will start at the first
global in the database. And if you do not supply a global after the colon, it
will end with the last global in the database.
.PP
.B
Note
that you must not have any space between the globals and the colon.
.PP
Again, it does not require that you supply the initial ^ of a global reference.

.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
$ mumps -r KBAWDUMP DD
.IP
$ mumps -r KBAWDUMP 'DD(0,1)'
.IP
$ mumps -r GLOBALS^KBAWDUMP
.IP
$ mumps -r GLOBALS^KBAWDUMP DI:TMP
.IP
$ mumps -r GLOBALS^KBAWDUMP DI:
.IP
$ mumps -r GLOBALS^KBAWDUMP :TMP

.SH BUGS
There are no known bugs, but KBAWDUMP has to deal with MUMPS syntax,
so there are more than likely always going to be around 3 bugs.
