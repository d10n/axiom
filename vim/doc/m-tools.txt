Utility package for the GT.M programming language                    *m-tools*

1. Syntax file for GT.M              |m-tools-syntax|
2. Datetime stamp                    |m-tools-datetime|
3. Dump the contents of a global     |m-tools-globaldump|
4. Jump to labels in routines        |m-tools-mtags|

==============================================================================
1. Syntax file for GT.M                                       *m-tools-syntax*

Summary ~

The m-tools utility package for MUMPS/GT.M contains a syntax highlighting
file. It should work in VIM version 5.0 and above.

It contains the ability to define a dotted do-block in MUMPS as a syntax
region, and then transparently fold it, to give you a better view of the
larger context of the routine. There is a key mapping, bound to CTRL-N,
which will toggle syntax folding on or off. It is off by default.

In order to use syntax folding effectively, you should learn the folding
commands that are built in to vim. For more info, see |fold-commands|.

Installation ~

It is called {mumps.vim} and in order to funtion properly, it should be
installed in: >

    ~/.vim/syntax
<
The m-tools package comes with an script, called 'install', that does
this automatically for you. But you've most likely already run this script
or you probably wouldn't have this documentation included in your VIM help
system.

Additonal scripts ~

The syntax file requires a script called {syntax.vim} which should be
installed in: >

    ~/.vim/ftplugin/mumps
<
It will be sourced automatically whenever you open up a file of type
mumps. Again, the installation script provided with m-tools does this
automatically. This script sets a few options needed by the syntax file in
order to function properly. The options are set either locally to the
buffer, or are reset when changing buffers to one that is not file of type
mumps.

Disclaimer ~

Keep in mind that syntax highlighting relies upon regular expressions, and
if you think regular expressions are the answer to your problem, you now
have two problems. MUMPS is a difficult language to map with only regular
expressions, so there are instances where you will be able to write
invalid MUMPS code, and the syntax highlighting will not alert you to that
fact. I will try to continue improving the syntax file, but for now, it is
what it is.

Known Issues ~

At the present, I know of only one bug in the syntax highlighting. If an
under-score character '_' comes immediately before or immediately after
an intrinsic function, then it will not color the intrinsic function,
but will instead color it like it was a variable. This only happens with
the underscore '_' character, and I have no idea why it is happening.

==============================================================================
2. Datetime stamp                                           *m-tools-datetime*

Summary ~

The m-tools package comes with an automatic datetime stamp function, which
will imprint a new datetime stamp in a VistA SAC compliant way. There is a
key mapping, bound to CTRL-H, that will toggle the stamp on or off. It is
on by default, since you should be SAC compliant.

Installation ~

The script is called {datetime.vim} and should be installed in: >

    ~/.vim/ftplugin/mumps
<
It will be installed in the right place automatically by the install script.

==============================================================================
3. Dump the contents of a global                          *m-tools-globaldump*

Summary ~

The m-tools package comes with functionality to display, either in the current
buffer, or in a vertical split screen, the contents of a MUMPS global. It can
display either an entire global, or just a particular subscript in a global.

When opening a buffer containing a MUMPS/GT.M routine, a key mapping will be
created, bound to CTRL-K, which will allow you to dump the contents of the
global reference underneath the cursor. You should have your cursor on the
'^' that begins the global reference, to ensure that you are getting the
right reference.

Installation ~

The script is called {globaldump.vim} and should be installed in: >

    ~/.vim/ftplugin/mumps
<
It will be installed in the right place automatically by the install script.

                                                                        *:ZWR*

In addition to the key mapping for CTRL-K, the m-tools package provides a user
defined ex command, called 'ZWR', which is used as follows.

:ZWR {value}
              {value} represents a MUMPS global reference
              with or without subscripts. It is not
              necessary to type the initial '^', nor to
              quote or escape {value}.

                                                               *b:globalsplit*

There is a buffer variable, called {b:globalsplit}, which controls whether
a global dump is shown in a vertical split screen, or in the current buffer.
It defaults to a vertical split screen. When in this mode, while in a split
screen, the key mapping for CTRL-K will now close the split screen, and
clean up after itself. If {b:globalsplit is set to 1, a global dump will
write to a vertical split screen, and you can navigate between the split
screens via CTRL-W CTRL-W. For more information about split screens, see
|new-vertsplit|.

There are two more key mappings that make it more convenient to resize the
split screen containg the contents of the global reference. While in the
right screen, containing the global data, the comma key ',' will increase the
size of the screen, and the period key '.' will decrease it.

Disclaimer ~

There may be bugs in the handling of global references. It is a tricky
endeavor.

==============================================================================
4. Jump to labels in routines                   *m-tools-mtags* *m-tools-tags*

Summary ~

When opening a buffer containing a MUMPS/GT.M routine, a key mapping will
be created, bound to CTRL-], which will jump you to a label in a MUMPS
routine. Though a new key mapping is created, it is actually used to
enable the use of the automatic 'ctags' functionality, built in to vim. The
built-in functionality is created for C and C-like languages, not MUMPS.

The behavior, however, is the same as if you were navigating C code using
'ctags' and a tag stack is created, allowing you to push new tags onto the
stack with CTRL-], and pop tags off of the stack, going back to where you
were previously, with CTRL-T. In addition to the key mapping for CTRL-],
the m-tools package can leverage the built-in tags functionality of vim.
For example, you can use the :tag ex command to jump directly to any label
in any MUMPS/GT.M routine. See |tags| for more information on how to use the
tags functionality in vim. See |ctags| and the documentation and man page for
the 'ctags' program.

Note: You must create a tags file, called .mtags or mtags, in your home
directory, in order to use the mtags functionality. In order to make this
simple, there is an included script that will build the proper tag file for
the mtags functionality, either manually, or preferrably it can be run daily
as a cron job. See the man page for 'crontab', via: >

    $ man crontab
<
Installation ~

The script is called {mtags.vim} and should be installed in: >

    ~/.vim/ftplugin/mumps
<
                                       *m-tools-mktags* *m-tools-mtags-script*

Supplied with the m-tools package is a shell script called 'mktags', which can
be executed to create a proper tags file for the mtags functionality. Here are
a few examples of how to run the 'mktags' command: >

    $ mktags example.m
    $ mktags directory/*.m
    $ mktags -ep directory/*.m
    $ mktags -gp
<
For more information about the 'mktags' shell script, please read the man page
supplied with the m-tools package, via: >

    $ man mktags
<
Disclaimer ~

There may be bugs in the handling of label references. It is a tricky
endeavor.

I hope you enjoy the m-tools utility package for editing MUMPS/GT.M routines
using the wonderful vim editor. If you have any questions, concerns, feature
requests, or bugs to report, please contact:
