" This is a companion script to the mumps.vim syntax highlighting file.
" It sets up certain options in Vim that are required for that file to
" work properly. It also sets up some options for the globaldump.vim and
" mtags.vim scripts. When you leave a mumps buffer it puts everything that
" it changed back to the way it was.
"
" It binds Ctl-N to toggle on and off syntax folding of dotted do blocks.
" It defaults to off.
